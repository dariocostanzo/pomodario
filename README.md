## The Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a "pomodoro", from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university student.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually comes with Python)
- For React version: Node.js and npm
